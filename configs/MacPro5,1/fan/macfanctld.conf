# linux-mac: Mac Pro 5,1 Fan Control Configuration
# For use with macfanctld or custom fan control script
#
# Status: PLACEHOLDER — needs real hardware testing
#
# The Mac Pro 5,1 "cheese grater" has MULTIPLE fans unlike the 6,1:
#   - CPU A intake fan
#   - CPU A exhaust fan
#   - CPU B intake fan (dual-CPU models only)
#   - CPU B exhaust fan (dual-CPU models only)
#   - PCI/GPU fan
#   - Power supply fan
#   - Optical drive fan (often removed)
#
# Sensors available via applesmc (paths need hardware verification):
#   /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/fan*_min
#   /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/fan*_max
#   /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/fan*_output
#   /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/temp*_input
#
# NOTE: The exact fan numbering and sensor mapping differs from the 6,1.
# Someone with actual hardware needs to run:
#   ls /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/fan*
#   ls /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/temp*
#   cat /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/temp*_label
# and document the mapping here.
#
# Temperature thresholds (estimated, needs verification):
#   CPU idle:     30-40°C
#   CPU load:     55-75°C (Westmere runs cooler than Ivy Bridge)
#   GPU idle:     35-45°C (stock 5770 is low power)
#   GPU load:     60-85°C (varies wildly with GPU upgrade)
#   Danger zone:  >95°C

# --- macfanctld config (PLACEHOLDER) ---
# These values are estimates. Do NOT deploy without hardware testing.

# Minimum fan speed (RPM) — conservative
fan_min: 800

# Temperature -> fan speed curve
temp_low: 40
temp_high: 80
fan_low: 800
fan_high: 2800

# Poll interval in seconds
poll_interval: 2

# --- TODO for contributors ---
# 1. Document actual fan count and numbering on your 5,1
# 2. Map temperature sensors to components (CPU A, CPU B, GPU, ambient)
# 3. Determine safe min/max RPM for each fan
# 4. Test with stock GPU and with upgraded GPU (different thermal load)
# 5. Dual-CPU models need separate curves for CPU A and CPU B fans
