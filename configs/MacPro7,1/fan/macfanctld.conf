# linux-mac: Mac Pro 7,1 Fan Control Configuration
# For use with macfanctld or custom fan control script
#
# Status: PLACEHOLDER — needs real hardware testing
#
# The Mac Pro 7,1 has a sophisticated cooling system with multiple fans:
#   - 3x large impeller fans (top exhaust)
#   - Various internal fans for specific zones
#   - The exact count and layout needs hardware verification
#
# Sensors available via applesmc (paths need hardware verification):
#   /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/fan*_min
#   /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/fan*_max
#   /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/fan*_output
#   /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/temp*_input
#
# NOTE: The T2 chip may mediate fan control on the 7,1. If applesmc
# doesn't expose fans, the T2 may be managing them independently.
# This is one of the things that needs hardware testing to determine.
#
# Temperature thresholds (estimated, needs verification):
#   CPU idle:     30-40°C (Cascade Lake has good idle temps)
#   CPU load:     60-85°C (28-core configs run hotter)
#   GPU idle:     35-45°C
#   GPU load:     70-95°C (Vega II / W6800X can run very hot)
#   Danger zone:  >100°C

# These values are estimates. Do NOT deploy without hardware testing.

# Minimum fan speed (RPM) — conservative
fan_min: 800

# Temperature -> fan speed curve
temp_low: 40
temp_high: 85
fan_low: 800
fan_high: 2400

# Poll interval in seconds
poll_interval: 2

# --- TODO for contributors ---
# 1. Determine if applesmc or T2 controls fans on the 7,1
# 2. Document actual fan count, numbering, and zone mapping
# 3. Map temperature sensors to components (CPU, GPU, ambient, VRM)
# 4. Determine safe min/max RPM for each fan
# 5. Test with different GPU configurations (580X vs Vega II vs W6800X)
# 6. Document whether the T2 chip overrides manual fan control
